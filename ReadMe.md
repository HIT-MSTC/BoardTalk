Newsera
=====================================

What is Newsera
-------------------------------------

In the just-summer when the members of Modugi first came out of the 
idea of a English news application, neither of them could imagine this 
new project would get such a rocking name. "Newsera", interpreted as 
the combination of "news" and "era", refers to a new-born project aimed 
at developing one App pertaining to nothing but English news, which can 
be used as either an English studying tool or a news distribution centre. 

What Newsera does
-------------------------------------

Every single time entering Newsera, you will be presented a flow of news 
organised elegantly in your time-line. The pushed passage covers a large variety
of contents ranging from Greek Crisis to Kim Kardashian's sex tape, with 
which you can sharpen your reading skills in a most amusing and relaxing 
daily routine. 

How Newsera works
-------------------------------------

With the assistance of VPN, the server crosses the GFW and scrawls down a 
set of certain websites, such as Reuters, FT, WallStreetMail, to get raw 
passages. After a processing procedure, the raw materials are modified into 
a uniform schema and stored in the database along with an automatically 
generated abstract. 

On the contrary, the client side is responsible for cache management and 
text rendering. When launched, it sends a request to the server for possible 
new passages, after which process the client display time-line with news titles 
and abstracts. The whole passage will be rendered from XML data stored in cache 
with a single flick at the corresponding block.

Further target
-------------------------------------

After implementing the function illustrated above, we may or may not move forward to: 

1. Adding favourites collection function

2. Building an account system

3. Adding real-time dictionary look-up function

4. Adding word note function

5. Adding a sign-in record to encourage intensive studying

6. Keep track of user's reading speed and mark an estimated reading time for 
each passage

7. Cluster the passages into several different groups and show them separately instead 
of one single time-line
